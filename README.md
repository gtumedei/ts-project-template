# ts-project-template

This template is pretty much useless with Deno, there is really not much boilerplate for a new project.

## Workflow

- Clone the repo and `deno i`
- `deno run dev` to run in development and watch for changes
- `deno run check` to check TypeScript types before going live
- `deno run start` to run in production mode
